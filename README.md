// Snowman - A word guessing game
// Task: Take this basic game and incorporate functions and the following:
// 1. Keep count of missed guesses. End the game if the missed guesses reach your max.
// 2. Create  function convertTo_(word) that returns a string of underscores of the word parameter
// 3. Create a function print(word) that prints every letter of string word with a space after each letter.
// Remember: You are free to write your own functions if you think it helps.

// Task 2:
// 1. The puzzle now would be a phrase with spaces and special characters. In this game,
// spaces and specials (and numerics) are preserved from being underscores.
// 2. The puzzle might have uppercase characters. The user may guess upper/lower case letters,
//		The program must treat all cases as the same character
