# cpp_hangman

Another game coded in cpp is hangman. 

### Part 1: Take this basic game and incorporate functions and the following:
##### 1. Keep count of missed guesses. End the game if the missed guesses reach your max.
##### 2. Create  function convertTo_(word) that returns a string of underscores of the word parameter
##### 3. Create a function print(word) that prints every letter of string word with a space after each letter.

### Part 2:
##### 1. The puzzle now would be a phrase with spaces and special characters. In this game, spaces and specials (and numerics) are preserved from being underscores.
##### 2. The puzzle might have uppercase characters. The user may guess upper/lower case letters, the program must treat all cases as the same character
